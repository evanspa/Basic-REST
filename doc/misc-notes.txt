* Does a resource really need a handle to its parent?
* Why does a resource even HAVE a parent?  There's nothing about the REST style
  that says resources should have parents.
* Perhaps the notion of "child / parent" should be an 'archetype' type when
  defining a REST API.
* Hmmm...perhaps there should be a notion of archetype (like Maven); i.e., when
  expressing your REST API, perhaps there's an 'archetype' setting, and if you
  pick "parent_child", then certain validations can be done to the REST API
  you define.
* Any other archetypes?  How about just "simple" - i.e, just a collection of
  resources.
